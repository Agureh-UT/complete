      <h1>The Process to Get PCA Services Set Up in Minnesota</h1>
      <h2>Do you have coverage for PCA Services?</h2>
      <p>
        Do you know the process to get PCA services set up in Minnesota? First,
        you must determine if you have insurance coverage. In this state, most
        Personal Care Assistant (PCA) services are covered by Medical Assistance
        (Medicaid). However, if you're not eligible for one of these programs,
        Minnesota Quality Care can help you find out if you have coverage
        through other insurance you may have. If you don't have insurance
        coverage, we have reasonable prices for our PCA services.
      </p>

      <h2>Are you eligible?</h2>
      <p>
        To start, a public health nurse will conduct a PCA Assessment to review
        if you're eligible to receive PCA services. The nurse determines if you
        meet program requirements and, if so, how many hours of service you may
        receive. In addition, you'll need a prior authorization from your health
        plan, and after that a plan of care. Last, but not least, we find and
        train PCAs to care for you. Sometimes a friend or relative may even
        qualify to be your PCA!
      </p>

      <h2>We can help you through the process.</h2>
      <p>
        Does this all seem complicated? It is! Minnesota Quality Care was
        established in 2000 and has the experience to guide you through this
        process, beginning to end. We have shepherded thousands of satisfied
        clients through every step of setting up PCA services, all while
        following the eligibility rules in Minnesota.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, PCA services can allow you to stay at home, so it is well
        worth investigating. And don't worry! We do this every day, so we make
        the process as smooth and seamless as possible. After all, that's our
        job.
      </p>

        below.
      </h2>

      <h3>How to set up PCA Services in Minnesota</h3>
      <p>
        This "how to" describes the process to get PCA services in Minnesota:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Obtain Coverage for Minnesota Medical Assistance (Medicaid)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Firstly, if you don't already have coverage for Medical Assistance
              (MA), apply for coverage at your local county offices. Similarly,
              you can also apply online through MNSure.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you need PCA services and help with its expenses, then it is
              important to determine your eligibility. Most clients on MA and
              MinnesotaCare will have a health plan and, perhaps, a Care
              Coordinator to help them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Not everyone is eligible for MA. Even if you qualify for coverage,
              you may not be entitled to receive PCA services. Eligibility for
              MA is based on your income and, in some cases, on your assets
              (like your home and savings accounts).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Request a PCA Assessment</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once you have coverage, the next step is to obtain a PCA
              assessment. Minnesota Quality Care will help arrange an assessment
              with your health plan or county public health office.
            </li>
            <li>
              Subsequently, a specially trained Public Health Nurse will come to
              your home to evaluate your need for PCA services. The assessment
              is very thorough, and it will determine how many hours of PCA
              services you will have each week.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can read more about the PCA Assessment at the Department of
              Human Services website. Above all, it's very important to be
              completely honest with the nurse and explain everything you need
              help with.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Obtain a Prior Authorization from your Health Plan</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Once you have your assessment, you'll need a prior authorization
              from your health plan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your health plan will want to review your PCA assessment. Based on
              that assessment, they will first determine the number of PCA hours
              you're qualified to receive and then issue a prior authorization.
            </li>
            <li>
              Minnesota Quality Care will request the prior authorization for
              you. See our Resources page for contacts at all of the health
              plans.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Develop a Plan of Care for your PCA Services</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              So you have your prior authorization - what's next? After that,
              one of our nurses will come to your home to help you develop a
              plan of care.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the plan of care, the nurse writes up a very specific plan for
              the assistance your PCA will provide to you on a scheduled basis.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Find and Train your PCA(s)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Lastly, Minnesota Quality Care will find and train your PCAs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most importantly, you will work with us to decide which PCAs will
              come into your home to provide personal care for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              In many cases, you may have a friend or a relative who qualifies
              to be your PCA. If so, we will provide training and supervision
              for your friend or relative.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Ongoing Supervision of your PCA Services</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After your PCA services are set up, Minnesota Quality Care will
              walk alongside you every step of the way.
            </li>
            <li>
              Our nurses monitor your care and the PCA services you receive to
              make sure you are safe in your home.
            </li>
            <li>
              In short, if you have problems with your PCA services, we are only
              a phone call away.
            </li>
