        The Transition from PCA to Community First Services and Supports (CFSS)
      </h1>
      <h2>What is Community First Services and Supports (CFSS)?</h2>
      <p>
        Have you heard about the transition from PCA to Community First Services
        and Supports (CFSS)? Well, if you haven't, you soon will. In an effort
        to expand your choices and the way you receive care, the Department of
        Human Services is set to transition the Personal Care Assistant (PCA)
        program to CFSS in 2023. The transition from PCA to CFSS will occur
        gradually over the course of the year. Despite this being a big change,
        it is being done in order to make sure you receive the care you need,
        when and how you need it. In any event, just like the PCA program, CFSS
        provides help to people so they can remain at home and maintain their
        independence in the community.
      </p>

      <h2>What's the difference between CFSS and the PCA program?</h2>
      <p>
        First, Community First Services and Supports is designed to accomplish
        many of the same goals as the PCA program, and even more. In addition,
        the eligibility requirements for CFSS will remain the same as they were
        for PCA.
      </p>
      <p>
        CFSS covers activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental activities of
        daily living (IADL), health-related tasks, and observation and
        redirection of behavior. And while this transition is taking place, we
        at Minnesota Quality Care will advocate for you to make sure your
        services are maintained.
      </p>
      <p>To recap, CFSS covers the same activities of daily living as PCA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Light cleaning</li>
        <li>Cook meals</li>
        <li>Run errands</li>
        <li>Do Laundry</li>
        <li>Assist clients to bathe, shower, and groom</li>
        <li>
          Help clients in activities which require them to read, talk, and play
          games
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If so much remains the same between CFSS and the PCA program, then why
        make any changes? Because CFSS gives you more options and support than
        PCA and allows you to choose how your services are delivered.
      </p>

      <h2>
        CFSS allows people more control over their care. Some of the changes
        include:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An approved relative, such as a spouse or the parent of a minor, may
          now provide support care
        </li>
        <li>
          A worker training and development budget is received from the state to
          allow either the client or their provider agency to train the support
          workers who provide care
        </li>
        <li>
          The client will write a service-delivery plan with help from their
          consultation services provider as desired
        </li>
        <li>
          The client may buy a personal emergency response system (PERS) to
          provide back-up support
        </li>
        <li>
          Clients may choose to buy goods and services to aid in their
          independence
        </li>
        <li>
          There are two different delivery models to receive care under CFSS
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In addition to the changes mentioned above, DHS has expanded the ways
        you may chose to receive CFSS. As a result, a person may choose between
        an agency provider model vs. a budget model, depending on their
        individual goals and skill sets.
      </p>

      <h3>Agency Provider Model</h3>
      <p>
        This delivery model is similar to the delivery model used under the PCA
        system. Generally speaking, people who prefer employee responsibilities
        be handled by someone else (recruitment, hiring, supervision, pay,
        paperwork, etc.) will prefer the agency model. Under this model, the
        agency acts as the support worker's employer. Even so, under CFSS,
        people who choose the agency provider model still have input in
        selecting their own support workers, including qualified family members.
      </p>

      <h3>Budget Model</h3>
      <p>
        Of course, some people are looking for more control within the CFSS
        program. In that case, the budget model may be an appropriate choice. By
        and large, the budget model allows you to act as the manager and
        employer of your support workers. People who use the budget model
        recruit, hire, train, and supervise their support workers. They also
        need to select a financial management services (FMS) provider to help
        with payroll.
      </p>
