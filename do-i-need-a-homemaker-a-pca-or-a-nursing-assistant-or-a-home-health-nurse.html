        Do I need a Homemaker, PCA, Nursing Assistant, or Home Health Nurse?
      </h1>
      <h2>
        What's the difference between a Homemaker, PCA, Nursing Assistant, or
        Home Health Nurse?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Have you been told you need home care services to stay safely at home?
        Homemaker, PCA, nursing assistant and home health nurse - each provide
        different types of ongoing assistance and it can be confusing. Do you
        know what services each provide and which is the right level of care for
        your needs?
      </p>
      <p>
        We're here to help. Minnesota Quality Care will aid you as you determine
        which level of service is right. Not only that, we will strive to get
        you as much insurance coverage as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Homemaker</h3>
      <p>
        What does a homemaker do? Homemakers help with all the household jobs a
        client is no longer able to perform. Are once-easy chores like laundry,
        cleaning, cooking, and grocery shopping now a challenge? A homemaker
        helps with tasks around the house, allowing seniors to continue to live
        independently.
      </p>
      <p>
        A homemaker cannot provide medical services; nor can a homemaker help
        with personal care, such as bathing or brushing of teeth. For those
        services, you will need a Personal Care Assistant (PCA).
      </p>
      <p>
        Minnesota Medical Assistance (MMA), long-term care insurance, and some
        programs may cover homemaker services. MMA might cover homemaker
        services if you are on a waiver program, like the Elderly Waiver (EW) or
        Community Access for Disability Inclusion (CADI) Waiver. In order to
        keep a loved one in their own home, some families also choose to pay
        cash for homemaker services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minnesota Quality Care provides homemaker services. Coverage is
        complicated; however, we work through coverage issues every day. Contact
        us today to get started.
      </p>

      <h3>Personal Care Assistants (PCAs)</h3>
      <p>
        Personal Care Assistants (PCAs) require more training than a homemaker.
        If required, a PCA helps with personal care tasks. If you or a loved one
        need help with mobility or support to dress, groom, bathe, eat,
        transfer, position, or toilet, a PCA can provide these services. A nurse
        from Minnesota Quality Care provides the training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Medical Assistance, MinnesotaCare, and long-term care policies usually
        cover a PCA. Medical insurance you have through work generally will not
        provide PCA services though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coverage for a PCA is complex, so allow us to work through the details
        for you.
      </p>

      <h3>Certified Nursing Assistants</h3>
      <p>
        For a higher level of care than PCA services, you might need a Certified
        Nursing Assistant (CNA). A nursing assistant provides personal care -
        like a PCA - but can also do some health checks. They can take and
        record vital signs, set up medical equipment, and assist with medical
        procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certified Nursing Assistants must complete a state-approved program and
        pass a certification test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insurance might cover nursing assistant services. In a home care
        setting, the care may need a prior authorization; however, many
        insurance policies will not cover ongoing nursing assistant services if
        the only care provided is personal care.
      </p>

      <h3>Registered Nurses</h3>
      <p>
        A registered nurse (RN) offers the highest level of care. Insurance
        companies generally cover home care services from an RN with a prior
        authorization.
      </p>
      <p>
        An RN must complete a 2 or 4-year degree program and pass a state
        registration exam. The Minnesota Board of Nursing licenses all
        registered nurses.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Minnesota Quality Care, our RNs supervise and train the PCAs and
        homemakers. In addition, our RNs develop the "plan of care" for all PCA
        services.
      </p>

      <h3>
        So, what's right for you: Homemaker, PCA, Nursing Assistant, or Nurse?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We know that care is about more than just the body - it's about the mind
        and heart too. Whether it's help with a senior, tending an individual
        with a disability or a chronic illness, or aid with recovery care, we
        are here to help you and your family.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see, it's not easy to decide what level of service is right
        for you or your loved one. But rather than stress about your choices,
        why not contact us instead? At Minnesota Quality Care, we are proud of
        the service we provide to families. Our goal is to provide excellent
        home health care and keep people in their homes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let us help. We have served as a home care agency in Minneapolis & St.
        Paul since 2000. In that time we have faithfully served thousands of
        families. Let us serve you too.
